My name is Matt and I am an engineer who lives in Austin, TX. I have a BS/MS in EE from RIT and my professional interests span the areas of statistics, signal processing, optimization, machine learning, and software development. I have also earned music degrees from some of the top conservatories in the USA! Prior to my career as an engineer, I spent some time as a Jazz bassist. You can learn more about me by viewing my resume, or you can read my blog where I mostly write about math and fun things to do on Linux.
