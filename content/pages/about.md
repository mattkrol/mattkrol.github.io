<img src="/images/Matt-Krol_Selfie.jpg" alt="Matt Krol" style="width: 200px">

My name is Matt and I am an engineer whose professional interests span the areas of statistics, signal processing, optimization, machine learning, and software development. Prior to my career as an engineer, I spent some time as a Jazz bassist and earned music degrees from some of the top music conservatories in the United States! You can learn more about me by viewing my resume, or you can read my blog where I mostly write about math and fun things to do on Linux.
