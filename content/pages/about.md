Matt Krol is an electrical engineering student at the [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu), who studies signal processing, optimization, machine learning, and embedded systems. Matt also happens to be an accomplished bassist, and composer, who has earned degrees from some of the top music conservatories in the country.

Matt's interest in engineering began in his mid-twenties after taking a course in electronic music composition at the [Manhattan School of Music](https://www.msmnyc.edu>). As a result, Matt became obsessed with digital reverb, and frequency modulation synthesis, which ultimately led him to start pursuing a career as an electrical engineer.

Matt likes to keep himself busy, and often has many personal projects that he works on outside of school (this website is one of them). However, when Matt is not working on a project, he can most often be found responsibly enjoying a nice bottle of chianti, or a well-shaken daiquiri.

Recently, Matt has joined the research team at the [RIT MILOS LAB](https://sites.google.com/view/miloslab), under the direction of Dr. Panos Markopoulos. Matt's research focuses on methods for robust principal component analysis.
