My name is Matt and I am an engineer who lives in Austin, TX. My professional interests span the areas of signal processing, optimization, machine learning, and software development. I also happen to be bassist, who has earned degrees from some of the top music conservatories in the United States. You can learn more about me by viewing my resume, or you can read my blog where I mostly write about math and fun things to do on Linux.
