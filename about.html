    <h1>About</h1>
    <p><img src="/images/Matt-Krol_Selfie.jpg" alt="Matt Krol" style="width: 200px"></p>
<p>My name is Matt and I am an engineer who lives in Austin, <span class="caps">TX</span>. I have a <span class="caps">BS</span>/<span class="caps">MS</span> in <span class="caps">EE</span> from <span class="caps">RIT</span> and my professional interests span the areas of statistics, signal processing, optimization, machine learning, and software development. I have also earned music degrees from some of the top conservatories in the <span class="caps">USA</span>! Prior to my career as an engineer, I spent some time as a Jazz bassist. You can learn more about me by viewing my resume, or you can read my blog where I mostly write about math and fun things to do on&nbsp;Linux.</p>
