    <h1>About</h1>
    <p><img src="/images/Matt-Krol_Selfie.jpg" alt="Matt Krol" style="width: 200px"></p>
<p>Matt Krol is a B.S./<span class="caps">M.S.</span> Electrical Engineering student at the <a href="https://www.rit.edu">Rochester Institute of Technology</a> and is a Graduate Research Assistant at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/miloslab"><span class="caps">RIT</span> <span class="caps">MILOS</span> <span class="caps">LAB</span></a> under the supervision of Dr. Panos Markopoulos. Matt&rsquo;s current research interests span a wide range of disciplines such as: signal processing, optimization, machine learning, and deep learning. Matt also happens to be an accomplished bassist, who has earned degrees from some of the top music conservatories in the United&nbsp;States.</p>
<p>Matt&rsquo;s interest in engineering began in his mid-twenties after taking a course in electronic music composition at the <a href="https://www.msmnyc.edu&gt;">Manhattan School of Music</a>. As a result, Matt became obsessed with digital reverb, and frequency modulation synthesis, which ultimately led him to start pursuing a career as an electrical&nbsp;engineer.</p>
<p>Matt likes to keep himself busy, and often has many personal projects that he works on outside of school (this website is one of them). However, when Matt is not working on a project, he can most often be found responsibly enjoying a nice bottle of chianti, or a well-shaken&nbsp;daiquiri.</p>
